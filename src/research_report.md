## Methodology

### System Identification Framework

This research implements a comprehensive JAX-based framework for loudspeaker system identification, 
combining multiple advanced techniques for robust parameter estimation and model validation.

#### 1. Ground Truth Model

The ground truth model is based on the nonlinear loudspeaker model from Heuchel et al. (ICA 2022), 
implementing the following components:

**Physical Parameters:**
- Re: Electrical resistance [Ω]
- Le: Electrical inductance [H] 
- Bl: Force factor [N/A]
- M: Moving mass [kg]
- K: Stiffness [N/m]
- Rm: Mechanical resistance [N·s/m]
- L20: Eddy current inductance [H]
- R20: Eddy current resistance [Ω]

**Nonlinear Functions:**
- Bl(x): Position-dependent force factor
- K(x): Position-dependent stiffness
- L(x,i): Current and position-dependent inductance
- Eddy current effects (L2R2 model)

**State Variables:**
- x: Voice coil displacement [m]
- v: Voice coil velocity [m/s] 
- i: Voice coil current [A]
- i2: Eddy current [A]

#### 2. System Identification Methods

**Phase 1: Basic Nonlinear Model**
- Core loudspeaker model with linear parameters
- Diffrax-based ODE solving for dynamics
- JAXopt optimization (Gauss-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt, L-BFGS)

**Phase 2: Advanced Nonlinear Extensions**
- Polynomial nonlinearities for Bl(x), K(x), L(x,i)
- Comprehensive parameter optimization
- Validation and convergence testing

**Phase 3: Advanced Methods**
- **Bayesian Inference**: NumPyro-based MCMC for parameter uncertainty
- **GP Surrogates**: Physics-informed Gaussian Process modeling
- **State-Space Models**: Probabilistic state estimation

#### 3. Evaluation Metrics

For each method, we deliver the requested metrics:
- **Model Parameters**: Complete parameter dictionaries with uncertainty estimates
- **Error Timeseries**: Time-domain prediction errors
- **Final Loss**: Mean squared error (MSE)
- **Final R²**: Coefficient of determination

Additional metrics include:
- Normalized RMSE (NRMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Correlation coefficient
- Execution time
- Success rate across scenarios

#### 4. Test-Driven Development

All implementations follow strict TDD principles:
- Comprehensive test suites for each component
- Validation against ground truth models
- Robustness testing across diverse scenarios
- Statistical evaluation of performance
